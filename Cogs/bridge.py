This seems a little complex for such an easy problem. Therefore, a double-ended queue is used to solve the timestamping problem "naturally" since older messages will be removed first from the deque once it is full. This makes finding messages O(n*m) in the reply case, and O(n) in the edit/delete case. This is not optimal, but we usually limit these deques to 100 elements per bridge, which should be reasonably few to iterate a linked list (and a regular one of <10 elements within). I reckon the message fetch is much more likely to be a bottleneck in practice (though I haven't done any measurements). By appending to the left, we can find recent elements more quickly.
